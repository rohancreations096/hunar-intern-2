Cleaning data is a crucial step in preparing datasets for analysis or machine learning tasks. Below is an outline of the theoretical approach to handling missing values, removing duplicates, filling missing values using statistical measures, and identifying duplicate columns in large datasets:


---

1. Handling Missing Values

Missing values in a dataset can disrupt analysis and lead to incorrect results. These values can be handled using:

Removal: Drop rows or columns with a significant number of missing values if their absence won't impact the analysis.

Filling (Imputation): Replace missing values with appropriate substitutes such as:

Mean: Average of the column (useful for numerical data with normal distribution).

Median: Middle value in the sorted column (useful for numerical data with outliers).

Mode: Most frequently occurring value in the column (useful for categorical data).

2. Removing Duplicates

Duplicates in a dataset can arise due to data entry errors, redundant data sources, or merging datasets. These can be handled as follows:

Row Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate rows based on all or selected columns.

Column Duplicates: Check for columns with identical data and remove them, retaining only one.

3. Filling Missing Values

Imputation is done column-wise based on the type of data:

For numerical columns, use mean or median.

For categorical columns, use mode.

Use conditional imputation for grouped data if trends exist (e.g., grouped by categories).



---

4. Identifying Duplicate Columns

Duplicate columns can bloat the dataset and may lead to multicollinearity in modeling. This is addressed by:

Comparing columns pairwise or using hash functions for efficiency.

Retaining one copy of the duplicate columns.

5. Efficient Handling for Large Datasets

For large datasets, memory and computation efficiency are crucial. Techniques include:

Using libraries like Pandas, Dask, or Vaex for scalable data handling.

Processing data in chunks or using distributed computing.

Optimizing column data types to save memory.

Steps to Implement in Python

1. Load the Dataset: Use pandas.read_csv or other methods based on the data format.


2. Handle Missing Values:

Count missing values using isna() or isnull().

Fill missing values using fillna() with mean, median, or mode.



3. Remove Duplicates:

Use drop_duplicates() to handle row duplicates.

Use column comparison or hashing to remove duplicate columns.



4. Optimize for Large Data:

Use chunk processing, e.g., chunksize in pandas.read_csv.

Convert data types to reduce memory usage using astype().
